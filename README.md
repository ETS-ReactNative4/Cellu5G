# CELLU

Cellu is an Android application which allows you to locate cellular antennas nearby.
It displays antennas close to you according to the current device location, obtained by the device's GPS module.
Users can also locate nearby antennas based on a specific address that being chosen from a list of all streets and cities in Israel.

This app is an open-source project, made with LOVE by me.
